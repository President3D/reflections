When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When you like to share your repository with others or especially for open source projects. In these cases more than one developer likes to have access an contribute to a repository, so a remote repository is a good idea.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you only have full control of your work, if you pull changes manually. Moreover you would need to stay connected with the internet all the time and without a info message you would still not know, if the repository changed to a newer version.
