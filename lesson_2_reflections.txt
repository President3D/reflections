What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a hidden folder, which contains all the information about the repository and the commits. We need to do that, because git needs those informations to run the version control system.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Merging one branch to another, imports all the changes form the second branch in the first one. So you can add new function in a second branch, bugfix the function and merge it later with your masterbranch. In the meantime the masterbranch can have new commits. The diagram represent the times when we create a new branch and when we merge it, so we can understand which development steps were taken in the meantime.
